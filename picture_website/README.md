# This builds a Docker container from the repository and runs it to host a PyFlask-based website #

The website accepts a folder path as an argument, displaying all pictures from the specified folder for everyone on your local network to access. Set your image folder path by modifying:

## FOLDER_PATH=XXXXXX ##

* Port = 5000
* IP = same IP as host computer
* Once the container is built and running, the terminal will display the URL where the website can be reached.
